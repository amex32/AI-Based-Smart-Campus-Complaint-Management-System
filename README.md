# AI-Based-Smart-Campus-Complaint-Management-System
We propose an AI-based Smart Campus Complaint Management System designed to digitize and automate the handling of student complaints. The system provides a centralized digital platform where students can easily register issues related to infrastructure, internet, cleanliness, hostels, or academic facilities. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system intelligently analyzes complaint text, categorizes it into relevant departments, and assigns priority based on urgency and impact. The platform enables real-time tracking of complaint status, ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, the system generates data-driven insights and analytical reports to help campus administration identify recurring problems and improve decision-making and service efficiency.
